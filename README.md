ETL Process in Python

Description
This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using Python. The process is implemented in an IPython notebook file (.ipynb) and includes code examples and explanations. I also created a .py version for more structured, readable, and reusable functions. in presentation and analytics.ipynb i simulated a little bit about analytics data.

Installation
Clone the repository: git clone the repository
Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Open the IPython notebook file (ETL PROCESS.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment.
sync the database configuration

additional notes: 
- i call  all csv file on the data folder
- data profiling is a folder to store the result of analysis using pandas profiling 
- for sql output here i attach a file because the size problem,
- use .py in script for more refined used
